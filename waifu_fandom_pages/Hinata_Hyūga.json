  "full_text": "Hinata Hyūga\nHinata Uzumaki (うずまきヒナタ, Uzumaki Hinata, née Hyūga (日向)) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. Formerly the heiress of the Hyūga clan, she lost the position upon being deemed unsuited for the responsibilities of leading the clan. Nonetheless, Hinata persevered and from her observation of Naruto Uzumaki especially, Hinata found an example to follow. Through her membership with Team 8, she sought to become strong enough to change herself, if even a little at a time. A few years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata joined the Uzumaki Clan after marrying Naruto.\nBackground\n \nHinata is the oldest daughter of Hiashi Hyūga. When she was still a child, Hinata was almost kidnapped by the-then Head Ninja of Kumogakure, who was visiting Konoha under the guise of signing a peace treaty between their two villages. Hiashi killed him and saved Hinata, setting in motion the events that would become known as the \"Hyūga Affair\".\nBecause Hiashi was the head of the Hyūga clan, Hinata was raised to be its heiress and her family expected great things from her. But even at a young age, her father came to believe that Hinata was not suited for the role of heiress, as she struggled under his gruesome training regime, on top of him also believing that her timid personality prevented her from truly excelling. When Hinata's younger sister Hanabi started displaying superior talent, Hiashi began to reconsider Hinata's selection as heiress. In the anime, Hinata and Hanabi were pitted against each other to determine who would one day lead the Hyūga. Because Hinata was unwilling to harm Hanabi - a hesitation Hanabi did not share - she was defeated, disappointing her father. Hinata was then disinherited and turned over to the care of Kurenai Yūhi.\n \nOn the day of her enrolment in Konoha's Academy, Hinata was picked on by three bullies because of her unusual eyes. Naruto, despite not knowing her, immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged the red scarf he was wearing. When he regained consciousness, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. Hinata started watching Naruto from that point onwards, and by doing so saw Naruto's desire to gain attention and his struggle to exceed the extremely low expectations others had for him. Despite this, Naruto never lost faith in himself or his dream to become the Hokage. Hinata was inspired by this and started emulating Naruto, adopting his refusal to never give up as a means of earning her father's approval. In the anime, Hinata's growing affections for Naruto were noticed by the Hyūga's elders, who warned her to stay away from him.\nPersonality\nAs a child, Hinata was soft-spoken and polite, always addressing people with proper honourifics. She is kind, always thinking of others more than for herself, caring for their feelings and well-being. She doesn't like being confrontational for any reason. This led to her being meek or timid to others, as her overwhelming kindness can render her unable to respond or act for fear of offending somebody. Her father's constant push to alter this personality trait when she was younger only made it worse, eroding Hinata's self-confidence and making her even more bashful because she gained so little faith in herself and opinions. Despite being disinherited, Hinata loves her family very much, as shown when she \"agreed\" to marry Toneri in order to rescue Hanabi even though she knew it meant breaking Naruto's heart and the possibility she and Toneri actually would get married.\nHinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8. Whereas her father and much of the Hyūga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything, her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable. It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it.\n \nHinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father. But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself. Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting his nindō of never giving up to improve herself. To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village. By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened.\n \nThroughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faced Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning. She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up. Two years after the war, upon achieving her greatest dream of having her love reciprocated by Naruto to form a deep and committed relationship together, she became more expressive about her feelings. In the anime, she is able to laugh openly because of it. After marrying Naruto and he becomes Hokage, Hinata remains supportive of him and his increased responsibilities, even though she yearns for him to be home more often. As a mother and wife, she has become a master homemaker, keeping the family well-structured yet well-adjusted and happy. While very loving and supportive of her family, she is equally strict and assertive. Her newfound structured nature made her very intimidating and more easily angered when her family acts up, easily keeping them in line and swiftly punishing them for their misconduct. She is also insightful and wise with her words, realising that her children, particularly Boruto, take after Naruto in the desire to prove themselves to others and that she must believe in them to do things on their own.\nAppearance\nHinata is a girl of fair-complexion who, as a Hyūga, her most distinguishing trait is the Byakugan, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a bob-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; in The Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair extends beyond her hips and she would at times tie it into a ponytail. By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders. She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto and Toneri Ōtsutsuki.\nHinata in Part I.Hinata in Part II.Hinata during the Fourth Shinobi World War.1/3\nIn Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps her forehead protector loosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantry flak jacket and assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector.\nHinata in the Blank Period.Hinata in Boruto: Naruto the Movie.1/2\nTwo years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a form-fitting light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist and short dark navy shorts. She also wore thigh-high stockings with black, open-toed boots. She does not wear her forehead protector at all. Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a black long and sleeveless dress with a high collar, a long grey sash around her waist and matching long gloves. She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings. During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with a two pink coloured strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots. In the Boruto manga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it. She also wears her wedding ring on her left hand and has her hair cut into a short bob style with fringes covering the top of her forehead. She also wears a long light purple shirt, a dark vest over the shirt, short pants and small open toe shoes.\nAbilities\n \nOriginally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir. After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character. Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised by Hamura Ōtsutsuki as the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of the Tenseigan, even though she herself can't destroy it.\nOver a decade later, Hinata's prowess continued to improve, reaching Jōnin-level prowess despite declining the promotion to it. Despite being unprepared and reluctant to fight Hanabi, an active jōnin and the next Hyūga clan leader, Hinata proved herself formidable as she decisively defeated her sister in a match.\nChakra Prowess and Control\n \nFrom her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I resulted in her ability to free herself from contraints and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them into projectiles. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.\nWhen she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of his chakra because she is a member of the Hyūga clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attracts Toneri Ōtsutsuki. It is also because of her being the member of the Hyūga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, though she can't destroy it by herself, so instead she held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone without the Hyūga and Ōtsutsuki bloodline can't touch it.\nByakugan\n \nAs a Hyūga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, a dōjutsu that grants her penetrative vision in a near-360° around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra. With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Chūnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own. She can also use it in order to identify genjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area. In the anime, Hinata can use infrared vision and magnify in to see tiny targets. By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.\nPhysical Prowess\nAs is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in the Gentle Fist fighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals' chakra pathway systems and the 361 tenketsu that run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact. Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place.\n \nWhile Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created the Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms as an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms. By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use the Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use the Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm to attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks, which increases in power if used in conjunction with others. She also mastered the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms in the war. Two years later, despite her chakra being suppressed and unable to access her Byakugan, she was able to physically fend of many of Toneri's puppets be he needed to intervene. By the time she reaches adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist. As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu. Hinata is also proven to be very resilient, having survived an assault by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki.\nOther skills\nWhile Hinata doesn't usually use ninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, her nature transformations included Fire and Lightning Release. In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency in medical ninjutsu, able to use the Mystical Palm Technique to heal the wounded. Hinata is also proven to be a very talented knitter and cook.\nStats\nDatabook\nNinjutsu\nTaijutsu\nGenjutsu\nIntelligence\nStrength\nSpeed\nStamina\nHand seals\nTotal\nFirst\n1.5\n2.5\n1\n2.5\n1\n2\n1.5\n2\n14\nSecond\n1.5\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n1.5\n2\n15\nThird\n3\n3.5\n2.5\n3.5\n1.5\n2.5\n2\n3\n21.5\nPart I\n\nPrologue — Land of Waves\nMain article: Prologue — Land of Waves\nIn the anime, while the graduates of her Academy class are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team as Naruto Uzumaki. To her disappointment, she is instead added to Kurenai Yūhi's Team 8, along with Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame. Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father, Hiashi Hyūga, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of the Hyūga clan.\nChūnin Exams\nMain article: Chūnin Exams\n \nDespite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in the Chūnin Exams being held in Konoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat.\nAlthough Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter the Forest of Death with the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner, Akamaru, senses the Three Sand Siblings' fight with Team Shigure. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified when Gaara mercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest.\nAfter passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of the Hyūga Clan Secret Ointment so that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin, Neji Hyūga. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hyūga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says.\n \nNeji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchange Gentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed her tenketsu at the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her.\n \nNeji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. When Hayate Gekkō is about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observing jōnin. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team of medical-nin to be given emergency medical attention.\nAfter a month, on the day of the Chūnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at the Third Training Ground. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him. Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that. Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as \"weird\" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away.\nHinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again. Kiba gets an Anbu (Kabuto Yakushi) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.\nKonoha Crush\nMain article: Konoha Crush\nIn the anime, when the invasion of Konoha begins, the still-unconscious Hinata is kidnapped by Kumo-nin. She is rescued by Neji, who has had a change of perspective as a result of his loss to Naruto. Several days after the invasion is successfully repelled, Hinata attends the Third Hokage's funeral.\nSasuke Recovery Mission\nMain article: Sasuke Recovery Mission\nAccording to Kiba, Hinata visited Naruto while he was in the Konoha Hospital after his failed attempt to stop Sasuke Uchiha from defecting from Konoha. When she saw how badly hurt he was, she immediately fainted.\nBikōchū Search Mission\nMain article: Bikōchū Search Mission\n \nIn the anime, Team 8 (at Hinata's insistence) helps Naruto find a bikōchū, which he can use to locate Sasuke by scent. After a day of searching, Hinata goes off by herself and trains by a waterfall in order to create a new jutsu. Naruto sees her, though he doesn't realise it's Hinata; she becomes embarrassed when he later tells Kiba about the \"beautiful girl\" he saw. When they are attacked by members of the Kamizuru clan, Hinata uses her new Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms to save her team. Although they ultimately fail in their plan to use the bikōchū to find Sasuke, their near-success earns praise from Hinata's father, Hiashi.\nAcademy Student Lead Mission\nMain article: Academy Student Lead Mission\nIn the anime, Hinata is put in charge of a team of Academy students (Nobori, Daichi, and Matsuri) to teach them survival skills. Very little of their exercise is seen, but Hinata does teach her students how to establish a campsite.\nGosunkugi Capture Mission\nMain article: Gosunkugi Capture Mission\nIn the anime, Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata are assigned to catch a thief, Gosunkugi. Gosunkugi is captured by a bounty hunter before they can catch him themselves, for which reason their mission is officially deemed a failure.\nBuried Gold Excavation Mission\nMain article: Buried Gold Excavation Mission\nIn the anime, Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata are sent on another mission together in order to improve their teamwork, which their previous mission failures suggests they lack. While searching for a buried treasure, they are attacked by the Kedōin clan, who impersonate each of them so that they can infiltrate Konoha and destroy it from within. Although they escape from the Kedōin, Naruto and Kiba must stop them by themselves due to a leg injury Hinata sustained. She later returned to Konoha and mistakenly attacked Naruto, whom she believed to be an impostor.\nPeddlers Escort Mission\nMain article: Peddlers Escort Mission\nIn the anime, Naruto, Hinata, and Chōji Akimichi are sent to the Land of Vegetables to escort some merchants. A princess, Haruna, is embedded with the merchants, leading to an attack by the Janin. Hinata is tasked with guarding Haruna, and in the course of doing that she fights and defeats Jiga.\nLady Daimyō Search Mission\nMain article: Lady Daimyō Search Mission\nIn the anime, Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata are sent to the Land of Honey to search for the missing Kayo. When they start to notice something strange about the castle they're search, Hinata uses her Byakugan to discover that the castle is alive.\nSunagakure Support Mission\nMain article: Sunagakure Support Mission\nIn the anime, Hinata and the Konoha 11 are sent to help the Three Sand Siblings defeat the Four Celestial Symbols Men. Shikamaru Nara, their team leader, assigns Neji, Hinata, and Shino to clear out the areas.\nAfter they get back to Konoha - in a scene that happens at the end of the Sasuke Recovery Mission in the manga - Hinata serves drinks to Neji and Hiashi while they train together. At Neji's encouragement, Hinata watches Naruto as he departs Konoha for several years of training, vowing to work just as hard as he plans to.\nInterlude\n\nIn Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths\nMain article: In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths\nIn the anime, Konoha and Sunagakure hold a joint Chūnin Exam two years after Naruto's departure, which Team 8 once again enters. During the first exam, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino are seated in different rooms and are tasked with getting a combined score of exactly 100 points on their written test despite their separation. Neji comes up with the idea for teams to communicate which questions to answer by producing vibrations on the walls. After the initial testing period is over, they are given a bonus question: each team must unanimously select one of their members to disqualify from the rest of the exams. Team 8 selects nobody, which is the correct answer and which qualifies them for the next phase.\n \nThose who pass the first test must reach the Demon Desert within three days in order to participate in the second exam. Ultimately, Team 8 were among the first 30 teams to make it. The following night, as all the genin were ready to eat dinner, everyone grew nervous about the overly-sweaty Burami ruining the food, which caused the genin to quickly try to stop him, resulting in Neji using the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven and accidentally destroying the food. As tension grew between everyone over the recent event, an all-out brawl began. Eventually everyone lost their desire to fight when Fū arrived with her optimistic ways. The following day, as the second exam began Team 8 were given the same objective as they had in the exam several years ago: obtain a scroll from another team.\n \nFollowing a simple plan by Kiba, Team 8 began talking loudly for all to hear, waiting for another team with a Heaven scroll to come after them. Ultimately, they encounter Team Kazami, with Hinata facing off against Kazami. Deciding to make the first move Hinata begins attacking Kazami. Realising Hinata's goal was to attack his Chakra Pathway System Kazami creates various sharp air currents which she counters using the Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. During the ensuing fight the other team is able to steal their scroll. Despite Team Kazami's attempts to prevent Team 8 from pursuing them, Shino is able to track them using his kikaichū. During their search, Team 8 is ambushed by Team Kazami, though they are able to escape thanks to Shino's insect clone. They regroup and then reengage battle against Team Kazami, with Kiba ultimately defeating them. With their own scroll back and with Team Kazami's scroll now in their possession, Team 8 heads to the centre of the desert to turn in the scrolls.\nTeam 8 eventually gets lost in a sandstorm along the way. They are rescued by one of the exam's proctors, who brings them to where all of the other examinees are being assembled. They are informed that the Chūnin Exams have been cancelled; reports on the participants' performances will be sent back to their villages, leaving their promotion up to their superiors. When they get back to Konoha, the Fifth Hokage promotes Hinata, Kiba, and Shino to chūnin.\nPart II\n\nTenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission\nMain article: Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission\nTwo-and-a-half years after Naruto left Konoha to train, Hinata heads to a meeting with Kiba and Shino. As she approaches them, she sees them talking to Naruto. She screams in surprise and hides behind a fence while she tries to build up the courage to greet him. Having heard her scream, Naruto investigates the source and, finding Hinata, says hello to her, inadvertently making her collapse from shock. Naruto invites Team 8 to help him on a mission to find Sasuke, but they can't since they've already got another assignment.\nAkatsuki Suppression Mission\nMain article: Akatsuki Suppression Mission\nIn the anime, Hinata attends Asuma Sarutobi's funeral.\nThree-Tails' Appearance\nMain article: Three-Tails' Appearance\n \nIn the anime, Kakashi Hatake recruits Team 8's members to help him investigate one of Orochimaru's recently-discovered bases. During their investigation, they are attacked by some of Orochimaru's subordinates, Team Guren. When Kiba struggles against Nurari, Hinata switches with him, using her Byakugan to navigate through the smoke Nurari employs. The team's leader, Guren, soon traps Team 8 in her Jade Crystal Labyrinth Technique. Although the labyrinth's reflective surface makes it difficult for her to focus with her Byakugan, Hinata is able to locate Guren and defeat one of her Jade Crystal Clones, but is then encased in a crystal prison, where she remains until found by Team 7.\nWhen they come across the Three-Tails, Hinata is assigned to a team tasked with sealing it. They are interrupted by Team Guren before they can complete the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier, prompting Konoha to recall them and send Anbu to seal the Three-Tails in their place.\nItachi Pursuit Mission\nMain article: Itachi Pursuit Mission\n \nTeams 7 and 8 are combined into an Eight Man Squad with the mission of locating Sasuke or Itachi Uchiha. When they split up to search, Naruto, because he's a target of Akatsuki, is given a protective escort in the form of Hinata, Yamato, and Bull. Their group is soon confronted by Kabuto Yakushi, who offers them intel on Akatsuki and its members. Noticing something strange about Kabuto, Hinata examines him with her Byakugan and discovers that a third of his body has been taken over by Orochimaru's remains. Kabuto escapes and they later regroup with the rest of the team. Kiba is able to find Sasuke's trail, which they begin following.\nFated Battle Between Brothers\nMain article: Fated Battle Between Brothers\nAs they near Sasuke's location, they are intercepted by Tobi of Akatsuki. They make repeated attempts to kill or capture him, but every attack passes through him without sign of damage. Suspecting a genjutsu is being used, Hinata searches the area with her Byakugan to locate a caster, but can find nobody. She focuses on Tobi's chakra signature to try and understand how his ability works, but is mystified when it simply vanishes. Tobi leaves them when he receives news that Itachi has died while fighting Sasuke. Hinata uses her Byakugan to locate where their fight took place and they rush to reach Sasuke before Tobi does, but they are too late and cannot rediscover his trail.\nSix-Tails Unleashed\nMain article: Six-Tails Unleashed\nIn the anime, Katsuyu meets them as they return to Konoha to give them a new mission: helping the Tsuchigumo clan protect its forbidden technique. Kakashi sends the rest of Team 7 to complete the mission while he returns to the village with Team 8.\nPain's Assault\nMain article: Pain's Assault\n \nWhen Pain's Assault on Konoha begins, Hinata joins her teammates in defending the village. Pain later destroys the village, but Hinata is saved from harm by Katsuyu. Hinata's bodyguard, Kō Hyūga, is not as fortunate, but he refuses Hinata's attempts to find him medical attention. Hinata watches as Naruto fights Pain alone, initially obeying Katsuyu's and Kō's instructions not to interfere. After Naruto is captured by Pain's Deva Path, however, Hinata does not hesitate to come to his defence, forcing the Deva Path away from him. Naruto pleads for her to run away, telling her that she can't defeat Pain. Despite knowing this already, she tells Naruto that she will fight Pain because, after years of watching him and improving herself by following his example, Hinata loves Naruto and will do what she can to protect him.\nHinata starts attacking the Deva Path with her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists. In the anime, she succeeds in removing some of the black receivers that restrains Naruto and even hitting the Deva Path, but the outcome remains the same: the Deva Path quickly defeats her with Shinra Tensei. The Deva Path then stabs her with another black receiver, leading Naruto to believe Hinata has been killed and thus causing him to enter a version 2 form. Hinata, however, is still alive, and when Team Guy finds her, Neji gets her immediate medical attention. Sakura Haruno heals Hinata's injuries, allowing her to tearfully join in the village's celebration when Naruto returns after defeating Pain.\nFive Kage Summit\nMain article: Five Kage Summit\n \nNews reaches Konoha of Sasuke's recent activity with Akatsuki, specifically his attack against Kumogakure-ninja. Hinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 (while Naruto was absent) decide that Sasuke can no longer be allowed to implicate Konoha in his criminal deeds and they resolve to personally kill him. When Naruto returns to Konoha after learning of this and having his own confrontation with Sasuke, he requests that they leave dealing with Sasuke to him.\nPower\nMain article: Power\nIn the anime, Hinata is part of a team of reinforcements sent to Tonika Village to help Team 7 in the fight against Kabuto Yakushi. Hinata attempts to stop the Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone from taking chakra from Naruto, but she fails and is saved by Neji.\nParadise Life on a Boat\nMain article: Paradise Life on a Boat\n \nIn the anime, Hinata was present at the Hyūga clan meeting convened by her father, Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she was quite shocked. After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.\nLater, Hinata met with Kurenai and was told that several members of the Konoha 11 have encountered Naruto while he traveled to the Land of Lightning. When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the Fifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War. She was later invited to Yakiniku Q to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.\nFourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation\nMain article: Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation\n \nWhen the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Hinata is placed alongside Neji in the Second Division. Their entire division is sent to intercept a large segment of the White Zetsu Army, which Neji and Hinata join forces in attacking after Kitsuchi unearths the Zetsu army. Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition. After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.\nIn the anime, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino investigate a possible breach of the Allied Shinobi Forces' perimeter. They discover several White Zetsus within Allied territory, and in the fight to destroy them Hinata is knocked unconscious. One Zetsu impersonates her and successfully pretends to be her for a time using its knowledge of her feelings for Naruto, but Kiba and Shino eventually discover it and, after defeating it, rescue Hinata. On the second day of the war, Hinata helps members of the Second Division escape the area of Neji's fight with the reincarnated Kidōmaru. She later finds Neji unconscious with Kiba and Akamaru. Hinata examines their bodies with her Byakugan and discovers that their chakra flow has completely stopped. She reports this to Inoichi Yamanaka, who is able to use the information to help Naruto save them. Hinata tearfully hugs Neji when he wakes up.\n \nWith all levels of the Allied Shinobi Forces infiltrated by disguised White Zetsus, Hinata and the others are placed on high alert due to periodic surprise attacks by what they thought were their allies. When Naruto reaches the Second Division's location he starts identifying and defeating the disguised Zetsus, including three that attempt to attack Hinata. Although Neji is suspicious that Naruto may also be a White Zetsu, Hinata insists it's the real Naruto, which she can tell by looking in his eyes. Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him. She silently thanks him as he leaves.\nFourth Shinobi World War: Climax\nMain article: Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax\n \nHinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.\n \nNaruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.\nAs Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the Ten-Tails' clones: she starts performing the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on a Ten-Tails mini-clone, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists.\nBirth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki\nMain article: Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki\n \nWhen the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.\n \nWith Obito defeated, Naruto goes off to fight Madara, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight a final Zetsu. As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and restrained by the Ten-Tails' roots.\nKaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes\nMain article: Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes\n \nWhile trapped, Hinata dreams of sitting on a park bench with Naruto while they are watched in secret by Neji and Hanabi. Naruto and Sasuke eventually release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, freeing Hinata and the rest of the world and thus ending the Fourth Shinobi World War. They all return to Konoha to bury the dead from the war, with Team Kurenai and Naruto paying their respects at the mass funeral.\nBlank Period\n\nKakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky\nMain article: Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky\nOver a year after the end of the war, when Naruto starts spreading unsavoury rumours about Kakashi Hatake's relationship with Kahyō, Hinata is one of the many villagers to pretend to regard Kakashi with disgust. Kakashi hits Naruto when he discovers that Naruto is the source of these rumours, causing Hinata to actually regard Kakashi with disgust.\nThe Last: Naruto the Movie\nMain article: The Last: Naruto the Movie\n \nTwo years after the war, as the Rinne Festival approaches, Hinata decides to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the one he gave her when they were children. Although she completes the scarf, Hinata struggles to bring herself to give it to him, and it is only at the encouragement of Sakura and Hanabi that Hinata finally approaches Naruto. Once she finds him at Ramen Ichiraku, Hinata is intimidated, first by Naruto's many other female admirers, and then by the fact that he is already wearing a scarf that he clearly cherishes. Assuming she lost her chance to be with him, Hinata runs off. As she cries over the scarf alone, she is approached by Toneri Ōtsutsuki, who requests to be given the scarf instead. He captures her with his puppets and they try escaping Konoha with her, but Naruto defeats the puppets and rescues her; the scarf she made is ripped in the battle.\n \nIn place of Hinata, Toneri is successfully able to kidnap Hanabi. Hinata requests to be added to the team sent to rescue her. After leaving Konoha, Hinata is able to find Hanabi's trail using her Byakugan, which leads them to an underground passage. Shortly after entering the passageway, the team is trapped in a genjutsu that dredges up old memories. While Hinata relives moments from her past that relate to Naruto, the scarf - which she's in the process of repairing - gets loose from her bag and wraps around Naruto, sharing her memories and corresponding feelings with him. Sakura is able to release them from the genjutsu and they start to continue ahead. Hinata is held back by Toneri, who expresses his desire to marry her. He explains that he has taken Hanabi's Byakugan for himself in order to carry out Hamura Ōtsutsuki's decree to destroy the Earth, after which he can create a new world with Hinata's help.\nHinata refuses his proposal and vows to save Hanabi on her own, to which Toneri observes that she doesn't know where Hanabi is. Naruto interrupts them and defeats Toneri, who turns out to only be another puppet. Toneri tells Hinata that he'll return later for her answer. Naruto and Hinata reunite with the rest of the team and exit the underground passage, arriving in what they later discover is the Moon's interior. They split up to explore the surrounding landscape, with Naruto spending more time with Hinata. He now displays a greater interest in her thoughts and well-being, pleasing Hinata and giving her greater resolve to complete the scarf. As she is about to confide in him what Toneri told her, the rest of the team locates them and asks Hinata to look at a crypt they've found. There, Hinata is confronted by another member of the Ōtsutsuki clan, who shows her visions of how to stop Toneri and who introduces her to Hamura himself, who asks her to save the Earth.\n \nHinata does not share her visions with the others and starts diligently trying to complete the scarf. When they make camp later that night, Naruto confronts Hinata and assures her they will save Hanabi. He also tells her that he loves her, leaving her speechless. Rather, when Toneri comes for Hinata's answer, she gives the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. When Naruto asks Hinata if it's a lie that she will marry Toneri, she reluctantly does not deny it. Upon seeing Naruto being hit by Toneri's attack, Toneri immediately put her to sleep. After she wakes up in Toneri's castle, Hinata checks on Hanabi to make sure she's alright and locates the Tenseigan that Toneri is using to control the Moon's movements against the Earth. She spends her time making yet another scarf, and when she has a chance she slips away to try to destroy the Tenseigan. She is found by Toneri's puppets and Toneri himself detains her. Hinata tries to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy Earth, but he doesn't listen. After which Toneri destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, Hinata shed a tear over her regret about \"betraying\" Naruto.\nHinata is forced to go through with a wedding ceremony, but as Toneri is about to kiss Hinata, Naruto interrupts the wedding. After Toneri leaves with her, Naruto is able to release her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologises to him for her earlier behaviour, though he states he already understands and forgives her. Toneri becomes distracted by his own awakening Tenseigan, allowing Hinata to escape with Naruto to the primary Tenseigan's location. Because she possesses Hamura's chakra, only Hinata is able to destroy it. However, she lacks the raw strength to do so, and must instead channel her chakra into Naruto so that they can destroy it together. With the Tenseigan gone, the Moon's movements stop and the puppets that the rest of the team is elsewhere fighting are rendered inert. The team reunites with them, bringing along a rescued Hanabi and the remains of Hinata's scarf. Even though it's in tatters, Naruto asks if he can have it anyway, which Hinata happily complies with.\n \nToneri uses his own awakened Tenseigan to resume the Moon's movement towards the Earth. He then attacks them and captures Hinata, forcing her to watch as he tries to kill Naruto. Naruto ends up defeating him instead and Hinata, once freed, takes back Hanabi's eyes. Toneri tries to make one final attack and Naruto and Hinata prepare to face him together, but Toneri is knocked into space by the statue. Naruto saves him and Toneri gives up, allowing Hinata to tell him Hamura's true wishes: to protect the Earth, not to destroy it. Toneri is repentant and remains behind when they head home, vowing not to let the Moon endanger the Earth again. As they return through the same passage they used before, Hinata asks Naruto about the scarf he's been wearing. He tells her it was a gift from his mother, causing her embarrassment that she would be jealous. Upon hearing Naruto say that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, Hinata sheds tears of joy. As the passageway disintegrates behind them, Naruto propels himself and Hinata back to Earth, where they share their first kiss.\nSakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze\nMain article: Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze\nAfter returning from the Moon as an official couple, the news of their relationship spread like wildfire, leading to former classmates and older ninja teasing them. Months later, Hinata and Naruto organised to go on their first date to Ramen Ichiraku, as they were both off duty for once. Running into Sakura along the way, Hinata invited her to join them, but she declined. Later, the couple learned that she had been kidnapped by Kido Tsumiki, leading to them joining Kakashi in going to rescue her. On finding Sakura, they discovered that she'd already defeated Kido, prompting them to congratulate her on her victory.\nKonoha Hiden: The Perfect Day for a Wedding\nMain articles: Konoha Hiden (novel) and Konoha Hiden (anime)\n \nIn the weeks leading up to her wedding, Hinata was busy preparing for the wedding ceremony that was to be held at the Hokage Rock.

Later, after a troubling change in his behaviour, Boruto declared to his parents that he had awakened his Byakugan, shocking everyone. Hinata advised Boruto to go to Hiashi for better answers about his dōjutsu.\nLater, when she discovered that Boruto was skipping classes (thanks to a poorly written excuse from his classmate Mitsuki), Hinata quickly confronted her son. The following day, Hinata met with Shino and it was ultimately decided that Boruto would have to make up the time he missed with after-school classes. After Boruto left, Hinata talked more with Shino, apologising for the trouble Boruto was causing, noting that he wanted her husband's attention to the point where, like his father, Boruto wants to make a name for himself. Shino then convinced Hinata to talk to Naruto about Boruto's actions. When Naruto came home late briefly for a change of clothing, the two spoke. Naruto expressed regret at not being a more attentive father, feeling that his lack of actual parenting growing up made him subpar as one himself, Hinata insisted that for all of Boruto's actions, deep down he understands Naruto's responsibilities as Hokage.\nLater, Hinata made a big feast to welcome Mitsuki. Much to her joy, Naruto was also joining them for dinner as he finished work early. However, as dinner was about to begin, learning from one of his dispersed clones, Naruto left to investigate a strange release of chakra spreading throughout the village.\nSarada Uchiha Arc\nMain article: Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring\nIn the anime, when Himawari fell sick due to a fever, Boruto and Naruto argued about giving her rice porridge or hamburger steaks while Hinata was administering the medicine she picked up.

Hinata noted that Boruto was just like Naruto at that age, always eager to train with his mentor Jiraiya. Hinata then showed Himawari and Boruto a photo of the Sannin, who Himawari noted looked eccentric and wild. Hinata told her kids about Jiraiya's greatness as a ninja and how influential he was to Naruto, even becoming a father-figure. Later that night, Hinata found Boruto looking through Naruto's belongings for the Icha Icha series, hoping to learn more about Jiraiya and the \"wisdom\" it gave. After glancing at a few pages and seeing its adult content, Hinata sternly forbade Boruto from reading the books, insisting that he was too young.\n \nMeanwhile, the grown-up Sasuke and Boruto were later sent back in time to shortly after Sasuke's defection. There, the two pretended to be travelling performers and were put under watch by Naruto. Past-Hinata met her future son, who despite her normal shy nature, felt calm and open to Boruto.

To ensure that, Sasuke first used his Sharingan to erase the memories of everyone he and Boruto came in contact of the recent events.\nBack in the present, Hiashi's birthday was fast approaching, and it was suggested by Hanabi to throw a party for him.

He soon made his move to escape, only to be stopped by Naruto's brief show of power. When Boruto returned, he and the boy got into a confrontation over the latter's recent actions destroying Himawari‘s personal vase, which she made as a gift to Hinata.

After he left, Himawari told her she could help Boruto if she became a shinobi, and asked if it would make her worry more instead.\n \nWhile preparing for dinner with Naruto, she wished that their sons, Boruto and Kawaki, could join them. She asked Naruto how long their mission might take. After leaving the house, Kawaki joined them, wanting to talk to Naruto.

In this form, her clothes are similar to what she wore during the Bikōchū Search Mission, though the form itself is not based on the events of that arc. Awakened Hinata has a personality similar to Neji's during the Chūnin Exams, arrogantly challenging opponents and boasting about the power of the main branch of the Hyūga clan. While in this form, she is also able to use techniques such as Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms and Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven. Most Clash of Ninja games require that this awakened Hinata be selected separately, but in Clash of Ninja Revolution 3, normal Hinata can transform into her in the middle of battle by activating her Byakugan. A similar form appears in Ultimate Ninja 2, dubbed \"Byakugan Hinata\", with the main difference being she wears the traditional Hyūga attire.\nIn several of the Ultimate Ninja Storm games, the team combination of Hinata and Naruto is titled \"Secret Lovers\" or \"Joined Hands\".\nHinata is featured in the online game, Fortnite, as a playable skin, and she can be used with her Part II look as well as her new era look. Her Part II skin is labelled as \"Hinata Hyuga\", whereas her new era skin is labelled as \"Hinata Uzumaki\".\nTrivia\nSpringtime of Youth\nThe Springtime of Youth wiki has an article about this topic:\nHinata Hyūga\nThe name \"Hinata\" means \"place in the sun\". It can be written with the same kanji as her family name \"Hyūga\" (日向).\nIn the Live Spectacle Naruto, the role of Hinata was played by Saki Takahashi.\nHinata placed well in the Naruto character popularity polls, reaching an all-time high of sixth most popular.\nAccording to the databook(s):\nHinata's hobby is pressing flowers.\nHinata wishes for a rematch with her cousin Neji, and for a match with her father, Hiashi.\nHinata's favourite foods are zenzai and cinnamon rolls, while her least favourite foods are dishes such as crabs and shrimp.\nHinata has completed 33 official missions in total: 10 D-rank, 14 C-rank, 8 B-rank, 1 A-rank, 0 S-rank.\nHinata's favourite phrase is \"self-confidence\" (自信, jishin).\nHinata's name is referred as a pure white lily, the same flowers that were put on Neji's grave.\nDuring a 2010 interview, Kishimoto stated that many who work with him have told him Hinata is more of a heroine than Sakura.\nIn the omake for Naruto: Shippūden episode 165, Sakura accuses Hinata of trying to become the main heroine of the series because of her popularity, much to Hinata's confusion.\nIn a series of interviews from 2015, Kishimoto revealed he had planned on Naruto and Hinata getting together since the middle of the manga, even commenting that Naruto and Hinata were meant to be since she acknowledged him before even Iruka. Not only that, Kishimoto confirmed that Hinata was his favourite female character during an interview with Viz in October 2015 due to her kindness.\nAccording to Hyō no Sho, while in the Academy, Hinata had an A in taijutsu, cooperation, and classroom attitude, a B in ninjutsu and genjutsu, and an F in positivity.\nIn the anime, Hinata holds the title of \"Legendary Queen of Gluttony\" (伝説の大食い女王, Densetsu no Ōgui Joō) at Ichiraku Ramen, having finished a record of 46 bowls of ramen in a single sitting.\nStudio Pierrot's Settei's sheets show that Hinata was 120 cm when Naruto saved her from three bullies.\nQuotes\n(To Neji) \"I will never go back on my word… Because that too is my nindō, my ninja way!\"\n(To herself) \"Naruto… I have always watched you… Watched you for many years… Why? I don't know why, but whenever I look at you… I feel more courage within me… It makes me feel like I can accomplish something if I try… It makes me feel like I am worth something…\"\n(To Naruto) \"In my eyes… you're a proud failure! When I look at you, I get an intense feeling in my heart… Because you're not perfect… Because you fail… you have the strength to get back up… Because I believe that is what true strength is…\"\n(To Naruto) \"I used to always cry and give up… I made many wrong turns… But you… You helped me find the right path… I always chased after you… I wanted to catch up to you… I wanted to walk beside you all the time… I just wanted to be with you… You changed me! Your smile is what saved me! That is why I'm not afraid to die protecting you! Because… I love you…\"\n(To herself) \"Naruto… I've always been chasing after you… Even now… But once this war ends, I'm going to stop once and for all… Because next time, I will be by your side, holding your hand… walking with you! Please wait for me!!\"\n(To Naruto) \"Neji just said… that your life is not just your own anymore… Do you understand what he meant? Your words and desire to not let your comrades die… Neither of them are lies! What inspired Neji and carried him this far were those very principles! It's not just you, Naruto… we all hold those same words and feelings within our hearts. They're what bind our lives together and make us comrades. If we all give up and discard those words and feelings now, Neji's sacrifice will have been for nothing… And that is when your comrades truly die, for you are no longer comrades then. That's how I feel… Therefore… stand up together with me, Naruto… Because never going back on one's word… is my ninja way too!\"\nReferences\n↑ Rin no Sho, pages 113-115\n↑ Tō no Sho, page 141\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Sha no Sho, pages 150-151\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 Jin no Sho, pages 154-157\n↑ Retsu no Sho, pages 12-13\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Zai no Sho, page 31\n↑ 7.0 7.1 The Last: Naruto the Movie\n↑ 8.0 8.1 Boruto episode 18\n↑ Naruto chapter 102, pages 17-20\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 389\n↑ Naruto chapter 78, pages 10\n↑ 12.0 12.1 The Last: Naruto the Movie novel\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 166\n↑ Naruto chapter 75\n↑ 15.0 15.1 15.2 Naruto chapter 78, page 10\n↑ Naruto chapter 80, page 9\n↑ Naruto chapter 76, page 11\n↑ 18.0 18.1 Naruto chapter 526, pages 10-12\n↑ Naruto chapter 238, pages 8-9\n↑ 20.0 20.1 20.2 Naruto chapter 437, pages 10-12\n↑ Naruto chapter 615, pages 5-13\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 499\n↑ Boruto episode 1\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n↑ Naruto chapter 700\n↑ Naruto chapter 78, page 10\n↑ Naruto chapter 80, pages 8-9\n↑ Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day\n↑ Naruto episode 151\n↑ Naruto episode 150\n↑ Naruto chapter 196, page 8\n↑ Naruto chapter 611, page 11\n↑ Naruto chapter 394, page 15\n↑ Naruto episode 149\n↑ Sasuke Shinden: The Teacher's Star Pupil\n↑ Naruto chapter 617, pages 12-13\n↑ Naruto episode 151\n↑ Naruto chapter 614, page 10\n↑ Naruto chapter 521, page 10\n↑ Naruto chapter 633, pages 5-6\n↑ \"Boruto: Road to B\", page 2\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 284\n↑ Sasuke Shinden\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 293\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 396\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 397\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 398\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 402\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 403\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 410\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 413\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 232\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 279\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 305\n↑ \"The Day Naruto Became Hokage\"\n↑ Naruto chapter 699\n↑ Jump Festa 2010 Interview\n↑ ANN Interview\n↑ SJ Podcast Interview\n↑ Boruto episode 12\n↑ Naruto chapter 80, page 1\n↑ Naruto chapter 80, pages 6-7\n↑ Naruto chapter 98, pages 12-13\n↑ Naruto chapter 573, pages 9-10\n↑ Naruto chapter 615, pages 10-12"
