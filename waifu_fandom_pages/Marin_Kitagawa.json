  "full_text": "Marin Kitagawa\nMarin Kitagawa (喜多川 海夢, Kitagawa Marin?) is the female protagonist in the Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo suru series.\nAppearance\nMarin Kitagawa is an above-average height girl with a slim figure and fair skin. Her eyes are naturally a dark brown, although she is almost always seen with dark pink color contacts when she isn't cosplaying. She has long, glittery bubblegum-pink acrylic nails. She typically wears peach pink eye shadow, lip gloss and blush. She has blonde hair with an ombré transition to pinkish-red or citrus orange at the tips and reaching down to her waist in the rear; her side swept bangs cover a majority of her forehead and eyebrows, reaching to her eyelashes; two locks of hair flow over her shoulders and end around chest height. Her hairstyles include long straight hair, a single ponytail, a double ponytail, a double knot on top, a bun and a single top ponytail.\nMarin typically wears multiple silver ear piercings which include a captive bead ring through each earlobe as well as two round studs in her right ear, three round studs in her left ear and a barbell in an industrial piercing through her left ear. In the manga, she can be seen with a tongue piercing, but this was not included in the anime.\nMarin's attire varies according to where she is:\nAt school, she wears a white button shirt with one chest pocket the her left, a navy-blue tie, a plaid skirt, black socks and brown shoes. She also tends to wear a stretchy black choker, two bracelets on her left arm and a ring on both her right pinkie and left index finger. During the winter, this uniform may also include a black V-neck jumper and navy blue blazer, and the tie is red.\nHer casual attire includes a variety of outfits, allowing her to select one suited to the occasion.\nCosplay 1: Shizuku Kuroe\n \nMarin wears a shoulder-length wig with a violet tint, her bangs slightly spread out and covering her forehead, extending just above the fake eyelashes. The eyelashes are moderately long but only on the outer corners of the eye to create a droopy eye impression. She wears purple color contacts and her eye shadow is red. Her eyebrows are shaved and new eyebrows are drawn to best mimic the expression. She wears a black mob cap with three red artificial roses on top, the mob cap having an embroidered rose pattern. She dons a black maid gown with frills where the arm meets the torso. The cuffs are extended to cover the hand and widen towards the end like a cone and the end is ruffled. There is a brown leather choker attached to a metal ring with a chain extending from it. She also wears a tie. Her breast pockets cover the breasts, with two strings tied in a loop-back pattern going from frill to frill. A few NuBra's are stacked beneath the breast pockets to make them look bigger. She is slimmest directly beneath the breasts, where the dress starts. There are at least three layers to the dress, including a crinoline to make the dress look fluffy. The top layer is a rose embroidered pattern with frilled at the end, then there's a black layer and a frilled layer beneath. She wears black rose embroidered stockings. There is also a tulle and garter belt. The stockings are connected to the underwear with two strings on each leg. She wears black platform heels. The number 17 is written on her thighs, right beneath the underwear, as a detail of how many times Shizuku had intercourse. The way 17 is written is in Chinese tally marks, so another tally mark is added by each intercourse Shizuku has had. Why it says 17 is unknown, it might be what Marin got in her playthrough of Saint ♡ Slippery's Academy for Girls - The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2.\nCosplay 2: Black Lobelia\n \nMarin wears an officer's cap with a fleur-de-lis and an officer's jacket with epaulets and fringes. Beneath that she wears a cap. There's also an imitating jewel on her chest. Her dress is layered and fringed at the edges. Her accessories also include a choker and black gloves. She wears different color contacts symbolizing Heterochromia, her left being blue and her right being red.\nCosplay 3: Prisoner Veronica\nMarin wears a platinum blonde wig with a white choker, jagged teeth, a small cloth around the chest that emphasizes her under-boob, and short pants. For this cosplay, she wears orange-yellow color contacts and applies a foundation, so her skin tone matches Veronica's. It was finished quickly, thanks to its simple design, but Marin did not use it due to its large amount of skin exposure.\nCosplay 4: Liz-kyun\n \nMarin wears a burgundy red wig with twin tails and even bangs that go down her shoulders, her back hair being tied in pigtails with black, puffy hair bands that have horns. She also wears attachable pointed ears. The top piece of her outfit consists of a black, long sleeved top with a white ruffled yoke that has a white, buttoned collar that extends downwards along with a white ribbon. The sleeves are baggy and are cut off by white cuff sleeves with ruffles. Since the back of Liz-kyun's outfit isn't visible in the SuccuIDK manga thanks to the art-style and being covered by Liz's hair, Wakana took creative initiative and made the back of the yoke an upside-down heart shape. The bottom piece consists of only underwear, and the outfit is fitted with devil wings and a tail with a spade at the end. For this cosplay, her nail color is changed from glittery pink to black, and she wears olive green color contacts. \nCosplay 5: Shizuku Kuroe\n \nMarin reprises her role as Shizuku Kuroe, this time wearing Shizuku's Disgraceful Teahouse attire. As before, Marin wears a shoulder-length purple wig. On it, she wears a white ruffled headband with two black bows on the sides. Her dress is cut in a kimono style and features small black lace at the collar and large white ruffles at the cuffs, which extend past her hands. The upper portion of the kimono consists of opaque gray lace containing stylized roses. The lower portion is a solid dark gray with pleating. Over the dress, she wears a french maid's apron with ruffled shoulder straps. The apron has a thick waistband, worn just below the breasts and laced in the front, with a white bow at the rear of the band so large that it extends from just below her shoulders to her hips, where its ends terminate in ruffles. The apron extends to around knee height, where it terminates in the ruffles. On her feet, Marin wears Victorian style women's boots which end above the ankle. The boots have a moderate heel, a pointed toe, and no visible laces or buckles. Though her hands are often covered by the long sleeves of her dress, she wears gloves of opaque gray lace with a flower pattern. Marin wears shorts under the dress and, true to form, wrote the teahouse's menu on her legs. This costume lacks the large breasts of Marin's first Shizuku rendition.\nCosplay 6: Arisa Izayoi\n \nMarin wears a high-cut black strapless leotard with a suit jacket, gartered stockings, heels, a detached collar and bow tie, a rabbit ear headband, and a fluffy tail.\nCosplay 7: Rei Kogami\n \nMarin has short hair with a mid-part in the middle. The attire is a white suit jacket with a black lapel, a white vest with black buttons, a black button shirt with a royal design, white pants, black shoes, a rainbow rose in her chest pocket, and a white tie. The suit is a tight fit and provides her with a masculine figure.\nCosplay 8: Sakuya Shiratori\nMarin wears a gray wig with bangs styled by Wakana Gojo. For her outfit, she is wearing a ready-made movie version of Sakuya's school uniform. The uniform is a dark-colored gakuran. The top has a standing collar buttoning down from top-to-bottom.\nCosplay 9: Rose\nMarin wears a ready-made nun habit. She also wears a rosary around her neck. Her hair is black that is tied up in a loose bun with bangs swept to the left, although her bun is not visible under the habit. Her makeup has a horror feel to it, with mascara applied heavily on her lower lashes. After the dining scene, her face, hands and nun habit are stained with fake blood.\nCosplay 10: Archangel Haniel\nThe most challenging costume for Wakana Gojo to make, Marin wears a mantle with a white piece worn loosely around the neck. This neck-piece has two sets of laces on the front, though they don't actually tighten the fabric. The remainder of the mantle is dark gray with a gold stripe at the border and hangs to approximately waist length. The front of the mantle is left open, with two long strips dangling to ankle height. These strips come to a triangular point, from which dangles a bead and then a tassel. Two wider triangular strips hang from the rear of the mantle, also coming a point with bead and tassel.\nUnder the mantle, voluminous white sleeves drape past the hands. It's unclear if these are attached as an underlayer to mantle or to the chest piece, which is a corset within a stylized rib cage. The rib cage is the color of bleached bone and the corset is black at the top, gradually transitioning to white at the bottom. Marin wears a pair of riding pants that extend up under the corset and down into her thigh-high boots. The boots come to a spade-shaped point at the top-front and extend down into heels with a moderately pointed toe and heel shaped vaguely like a finger bone.\nIn this costume, Marin wears very pale makeup except thin red lipstick and abundant pink brown eye shadow. The costume includes fake eye lashes, which are especially long on top. Marin wears light blue contacts and a nearly-white wig with hints of pink and gray. The wig has bangs cut just above her eyes (below her brows) and straight chest-length hair elsewhere. She wears no jewelry in this costume and maintains an emotionless appearance, occasionally incorporating Haniel's mirthless smile.\nPersonality\nMarin is boisterous, extravagant, messy, and while quite mature, she's also clumsy. As a cosplayer and huge otaku, Marin is a big of fan of magical girl anime and adult video games. She strongly desires to cosplay as certain characters, seeing the notion of dressing up and becoming said characters as the ultimate form of love for them. Marin's love for the characters she likes extends to the point where she won't cosplay as them if she feels as though she can't fit their appearance, not wanting to spoil their image.\nShe is notably very kind, friendly, cheerful and outgoing. It's shown that Marin greatly dislikes overly-critical people that judge others for their interests, causing her to reject the advances of a boy at the start of the series who poked fun at her liking anime. Marin's non-judgmental outlook and friendly nature causes her to greatly admire Wakana, not caring that the boy is seen as awkward and quiet by others. She saw no reason to keep their newfound friendship and a secret, openly greeting him in the school hallways and later treating him at a ramen restaurant.\nMarin holds her own values and can be quite earnest when it comes to it, despite her cheery and carefree attitude. For example, she easily saw how Wakana was being taken advantage of by his classmates and told him that he shouldn't put up with that. Also, when Wakana began purposefully avoiding her out of embarrassment due to other students finding out about their friendship, Marin confronted him herself, telling Wakana to tell her outright if he had a problem with being around her.\nWhile possessing a mature side, Marin can be something of a scatterbrain on occasion. She poorly knitted a prototype of her first cosplay outfit (Shizuku Kuroe), despite a guidebook she possessed having step-by-step instructions. She is also a procrastinator, often opting to watch anime over doing work and completely losing track of time as a result. Despite this, she can be surprisingly proactive at times, such as finding out where Wakana lived so they could start their first cosplay project right away rather than waiting over the weekend. Marin claims that when she gets an idea, she doesn't waste time and gets straight to it, revealing a more rash and impulsive side.\nMarin is shown to be very bold and immodest, as she had no problem with allowing Wakana to take her measurements for her first cosplay outfit, and doing so while wearing a bathing suit despite still being early on in their friendship. She has a more teasing side, sometimes making jokes at Wakana's expense and laughing at whenever he gets embarrassed and flustered. These moments can be embarrassing for Marin as well, however, particularly when she begins to realize her own feelings for him. \nHer bold personality also ties into her love for the media she consumes. Not only does she love things that would not stereotypically be expected of a girl her age, like eroges and characters dressed in bunny outfits for example, but she proudly talks about them like they're no big deal, even to the point of obsessiveness. She displays her favorite characters for anyone one to see, whether it be a poster of Shizuku in her bedroom or a t-shirt with one of one of her ahegaos. She also seems to have an obsession with other girl's appearances, whether it being her commenting on their smooth skin or the size of their boobs.\nDespite being carefree, Marin isn't thoughtless of others, far from it. She is selfless and doesn't want to burden others by any means; instead, she tends to blame herself instead of putting it on others, warmly apologizing for any inconvenience, no matter how small. After seeing that Wakana had worn himself out to get her Shizuku outfit finished and fully sewn; a result of her not being clear with when she needed the outfit to be done. She broke down in remorse and tearfully apologized to him after realizing he had worked himself down to the bone for her sake, all the while juggling his own responsibilities, such as studying for midterm exams, as well as manning his grandfather's Hina doll shop and visiting him when the latter had hurt his back.\nShe has a habit of being embarrassed by seemingly insignificant things, while being woefully unaware or uncaring of clearly more humiliating factors. During the cosplay event as Shizuku, when a photographer Suzuka snapped a picture of her as the wind blew up her skirt and showed her boxers, Marin was more concerned that she wasn't looking at the camera rather than the raunchy photo of her, even when Suzuka apologized and said she'd delete it. When Marin hastily greeted Wakana at her apartment, she was startled and embarrassed to find out that she wasn't wearing her pink color contacts, rather than the fact she was still in her nightwear and had most of her top half exposed.\nMarin also loves eating but still manages to maintain her slender figure, until later on in Chapter 64. She's not a very good cook either as her meals are often greasy and contain large quantities of meat and rice. Despite this, she is capable of maintaining a diet for the sake of her modeling job.\nHistory\nMarin's mother died when she was very young, leaving her under the care of her father. Although he loves her, Marin's father is often called to work abroad, leaving her to live alone most days.\nPrior to the start of the series, Marin secured a part-time job as an amateur model.\nPlot\nOne day, Marin falls and hits her head on Wakana Gojo's table and apologizes, marking the first yet brief conversation between the two. The next day, Wakana and Marin are both assigned to afterschool cleaning, though things still remain awkward between the two. One day, Wakana was planning to use the school's sewing machine to work on a doll but coincidentally, Marin comes in and spots him. After admiring Wakana's doll and praising his work, Marin asks if Wakana could help her create cosplays, which Wakana accepts. Thus, a friendship blossoms between the two and the series begins.\nRelationships\n\nWakana Gojo\nAt the beginning of the series, it is shown that Wakana and Marin are classmates but have rarely ever talked. With Marin being popular and outgoing, Wakana describes her as being in a whole different world than him and always at the center of attention. The two briefly talk after Marin accidentally bumps into Wakana's desk, but Wakana shuts this down after becoming too nervous. The two later are put on afterschool cleaning activities, but things remain awkward and silent. One day, after catching Wakana using the school's sewing machine and learning that he was a hina dollmaker, she asks him to make her cosplay clothes and reveals she has a deep passion for cosplaying. Wakana promises he'll help her out and receives commission fees for his work. She is very vocal about complimenting his costumes and always supports him in anything he does. At the end of Volume 2, Marin realizes she is in love with Wakana, and throughout the series, continually does whatever she can to invite him to places and spend time with him. In Chapter 36, they went to a love hotel during a shoot, leaving Marin flustered and her heart beating frantically. After her father demanded that she do her summer homework, she frequently went to Wakana's house for him to help her homework and eat with him. Marin tends to get flushed around Wakana if he says anything to compliment her, and admires his passion to do what he loves. She can also get frustrated with Wakana when he outright denies any rumor that the two are dating, given that Wakana thinks that she would never date someone like him (unknowing to her), leaving her upset. It's clear that just being around him makes her happy, and she's never once denied a rumor or disliked the idea that they're together, while also being happy upon hearing that Wakana is single and always has been, clearly hinting that she wants more in their friendship.\nAs time passes, Marin's feelings for Wakana continue to grow, to the point where she gathers her courage in order to confess to him and ask him out. However, Marin imagines her confession and believes that Wakana will not know how to take it and will start avoiding her again, something that causes Marin to cry. Marin continues to hang out with Wakana regardless, reflecting over when she first asked him out and that it was no big deal if he said no, but reveals that now, the thought of Wakana saying no scares her. After Wakana cooked dinner for her at his house and did his best to make it alright for her diet, Marin realized that Wakana still cares about her and wasn’t deterred from spending time with him.\nIn chapter 107, following Wakana's confession to her, Marin also confesses to him, jumping on him and passionately kissing him. They are then seen on the floor having an intimate moment.\nIn chapter 109 After the confession and kiss, Marin is shown to now be very clingy to Gojo, not letting go of him and not wanting him to go home, even going as far as following home and being told by Gojo to go home.\nIn chapter 115, a photo is shown indicating that they got married. They also had a daughter called Nichika.\nKaoru Gojo\nDespite the way they met, with Kaoru assuming that her and Wakana did something inappropriate, Kaoru apologizes for having raised his voice and later gets on well with Marin. He becomes concerned for the girl after seeing her regular diet and poor cooking, choosing to invite her for dinner every now and then, showing that he cares for her wellbeing.\nNowa Sugaya\nAmong her group of friends, Marin is often seen hanging out with Nowa outside of her work with Wakana. They are shown to get along well, as they've both gone to have their hair done and have eaten together.\nDaia & Rune\nI'll have to fill in the blanks and imagine them...Please help the Sono Bisque Doll Wiki by expanding this section.\nSajuna Inui\nMarin is a major fan of Juju's cosplays, finding her immensely adorable. Upon meeting her in the flesh at Wakana Gojo's house, Marin freaks out and fangirls over her to the point of making Sajuna uncomfortable. The two have a stable friendship, and Marin was overjoyed to have cosplayed with her. While Sajuna refused to do a collaboration cosplay with her at first, Marin convinced her by saying that she'd split the studio rent. It is clear that they both enjoyed their time afterwards.\nShinju Inui\nMarin was eager to meet Sajuna Inui's younger sister in wanting to learn about Juju's photography. At first, she pictured Shinju as a smaller and cuter version of her older sister, but was quite surprised to find out that Shinju was both taller and older-looking than Sajuna. Regardless, the two become good friends quickly. Marin was also in awe over her Soma Tengeji cosplay, finding her male appearance with a girl's face to be amazingly cute. When Wakana Gojo revealed that him and Shinju kept the latter's cosplay a secret and that the two worked together on it, Marin showed some signs of jealousy that Wakana worked with another girl on cosplaying alone, but she soon shrugged it off.\nAkira Ogata\nIn the first moment, Akira seemed to not like Marin and try to avoid her as much as possible. On Chapter 85, it is revealed that actually Akira is actually a big fan of Marin since she saw her Black Lobelia cosplay and avoided getting close to her because she got nervous being around her. She considers her her \"Princess\" and says she bought every issue of the magazines in which Marin appeared.\nManabu & Hikaru\nI'll have to fill in the blanks and imagine them...Please help the Sono Bisque Doll Wiki by expanding this section.\nMasumi Kitagawa (Father)\nThey are on friendly terms, although he wishes that she'd be more hard-working because her laziness is taking after him.\nMrs. Kitagawa (Mother)\nShe died when Marin was a kid from an illness. \nEtymology\nThe name Marin means \"sea dream\" (海夢).\nMarin's surname Kitagawa means \"joy\" (喜) (ki), \"many\" (多) (ta) and \"river, stream\" (川) (kawa/gawa).\nGallery\nMain article: Marin Kitagawa/Gallery\nTrivia\nPrisoner Veronica is an evident reference to Ramlethal Valentine of the Guilty Gear series, more specifically of the Xrd series.\nIn the anime, her character preview that Marin and Wakana watched is akin to those of Guilty Gear -Strive-'s character trailers.\nDespite her elegant demeanor and the fact that she enjoys going to beaches, Marin cannot swim or even float.\nOne of Marin's most iconic cosplays features her wearing a gothic-style dark dress, complete with intricate lace and rose accents. This look is inspired by her love for the character Shizuku Kuroe, reflecting Marin's impeccable sense of style and dedication to bringing her favorite characters to life through cosplay.\nIn the manga, it is canonical that Marin has a tongue piercing. This can only be seen in a few places; such as the Volume 2 Afterward, Chapter 32, Chapter 38, and the cover of Volume 7; in most other places the piercing is either omitted or the mouth is not sufficiently detailed to show it. Her tongue piercing is not seen in the anime, despite including the scene in Chapter 38 where it is seen in the manga. The reason for this is unclear, but speculation largely assumes that it was done to avoid the stereotype linking tongue piercings to a proclivity for oral sex. Others speculate that it was done to distance Marin from the negative cultural impression of gyaru culture in Japan or simply because Marin is canonically fifteen at the onset.\nMarin's three sizes are B86.8cm/W58.7cm/H84.8cm\nReferences\n↑ My Dress-Up Darling Manga — Vol. 4 Chapter 27.\n↑ My Dress-Up Darling Manga and Anime — Vol. 5 Chapter 37 and Episode 12.\n↑ \nMy Dress-Up Darling Anime Fanbook — Profile (p. 14).\n↑ My Dress-Up Darling Anime — Episode 13.\n↑ Official anime Twitter says March 5th is Marine's Birthday\n↑ Funimation Tweet\n↑ My Dress-Up Darling Manga — Vol. 2 Chapter 15 (p. 12).\n↑ My Dress-Up Darling Manga — Vol. 5 Chapter 37 \n↑ Visual of cosplay dress\n↑ Volume 2 Afterward\nNavigation\nList of Characters\nSchool\nMain\nMarin Kitagawa • Wakana Gojo\nClassmates & Others\nNowa Sugaya • Daia Yahiro • Rune Yamauchi • Kensei Morita • Murakami • Shiki Kashiwagi • Takeru Koga • Seira Kasai • Karen Otsuka • Hanaoka (Teacher) • Student Council President\nFriends\nCosplay\nSajuna Inui • Shinju Inui • Chitose Amano • Akira Ogata • Miyako • Suzuka • Yosuke\nAIRS Salon\nManabu Hasegawa • Hikaru Kikuchi • Riho Aizawa\nOthers\nNobara Aoyagi • Usami • Rana • Marin's Editor\nFamily & Relatives\nGojo Family\nWakana Gojo • Nichika Gojo • Kaoru Gojo • Miori Gojo • Harumi\nKitagawa Family\nMarin Kitagawa • Masumi Kitagawa\nInui Family\nSajuna Inui • Shinju Inui • Mrs. Inui\nAmano Family\nChitose Amano • Chitose's Sister • Chitose's Mother\nManga/Anime Industry\nProfessionals\nTokio Shiba • Shougo Mizoue • Abe\nCategory • Fictional Characters • Minor Characters"
